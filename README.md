# clash of flags 1st wave challenges
Clash of Flags was a 48 hours jeopardy style capture the flag event, organized by the [NIT Computer Society Club](https://www.instagram.com/ncs._club/). It is the first ctf event and cybersecurity related event for the club and the ~university~ institute, it took place at Cyberpark of El Rahmania, Algiers, Algeria, between the 10th and 11th of april 2025.

This event was made with the help of a lot of people especialy from the [shellmates club](https://www.shellmates.club/). the first wave of the event was constituted of 21 working challenges if i remember well, the rest of the waves were made by the shellmates guys, this repository has only the 1st wave, the rest may be lost in some google cloud server.

**this repository does not have writeups, and the docker compose is wrong, this repository is only for archive purposes.**

I want to personaly thank all of those who to be honest saved the event, starting with the shellmates guys [Abderaouf Louggani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abderaouf-louggani-935b50206/), [Abderahmane OUBAHI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abderahmane-oubahi-a72240243/), [DJERRAI SMAIL](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djerrai-smail-a473a322b/), they helped me figure out things before the event, then came in person that day, handled the rest of it and made sure everybody was busy playing the ctf. I also want to thank my friends from the club [Anes Hamma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamma-abdourahman-anas-24960726b/), [souhaib benabdallah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/souhaib-benabdallah-2b92a1237/) and of course [lekbal baraa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baraa-lekbal-46272a360/), They directly contributed to the making and the somehow succes of the event, i never had the ocasion to thank them -- maybe i will make it a linkedin post :P -- so let this useless archive repository's readme file be the vehicule of my sincere gratitude to those wonderful people.
