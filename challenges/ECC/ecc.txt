Elliptic Curve:
secp256k1
Generator Point (G) used

Your private key (x): 773
Senderâ€™s public key (P): 773 * G  (but we give you the actual point below)

P = (0x49fbc7859bbca537ebbd0cbefb2cb529c04821df15c72c87cdacc7e77892ff5b  ,0xb0f1a8a87948a2a2f1248d8a1617468ed3c88cf1a8b2b377af018183e7c34ee3 )   

Task: Derive the shared secret by multiplying P with your private key.
Then hash the shared secret's x-coordinate to get the flag.
the hash used is SHA-256.
The flag is in the format: COF{first_16_chars_of_hash}.
