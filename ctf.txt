Web Exploitation
"The Admin's Lost Password": Create a challenge where participants must exploit a SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve an admin's password from a database.

"XSS Treasure Hunt": Hide flags across different pages of a website vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

Cryptography
"Broken Cipher": Provide an encrypted message using an outdated or flawed algorithm (e.g., Caesar cipher with a twist) and challenge participants to decrypt it.

"Key Collision Chaos": Simulate a scenario where participants must break RSA encryption by exploiting weak key generation.

Forensics
"Memory Dump Mystery": Provide a memory dump file with hidden flags or sensitive data embedded in the heap or stack.

"Metadata Detective": Challenge participants to uncover hidden information in image metadata or document properties.

Reverse Engineering
"Binary Enigma": Create a compiled binary that participants must reverse engineer to find the flag hidden in the code logic.

"Obfuscated Code Puzzle": Provide a heavily obfuscated script and ask participants to decode its functionality and retrieve the flag.

Networking
"Packet Sniffing Challenge": Share PCAP files containing network traffic with embedded flags hidden in HTTP requests or DNS queries.

"Protocol Puzzle": Use custom or obscure network protocols and ask participants to reconstruct communication to find the flag.

Steganography
"Hidden in Plain Sight": Embed flags within images, audio files, or videos using steganographic techniques.

"Pixel Perfect Flag Hunt": Challenge participants to manipulate image pixels to uncover hidden messages.

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
"Social Media Sleuths": Provide clues leading to public social media profiles where flags are hidden in posts or captions.

"Web Scraping Adventure": Participants must scrape publicly available data from websites to piece together clues for the flag.

Attack-Defense
"Secure the Castle, Attack the Fortress": Divide participants into teams where one defends a vulnerable server while others attempt to exploit it for flags.

"Ransomware Simulation": Simulate a ransomware attack scenario where teams must decrypt files and recover flags while defending against further attacks.
