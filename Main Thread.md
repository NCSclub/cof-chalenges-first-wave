http websites that may have a backend i guess

## blog: **0 pts**
first level 
poorly made blog that looks old probably made with php,
we can browse through 3 articles,
the challenges:
- image displayed in an article is stored in a directory
    that itself contains a text file (flag) **10 pts**
- the same image has a flag in the metadata **10 pts**
- a comment in the html code (inspect) **5 pts**
- an article that is a tutorial on how to connect to a SSH server
    but that dumbass used his actual credentials (gets to the user1) (no flag)

## service website: **30 pts**

challenges are basic shell commands:

- regex/grep:
