# capture the flag:
- jeopardy style
    - a list or set of security challenges that consists of aquiring flags

# jeopardy style:
- reverse engineering

- Steganography
    - LSB Stegano

- cryptography

- misc (prog)

- pawning (try to get remote code execution)
    - xss injections
    - sql injections

- web

# we have to make big flags that are like the main thread to follow and small ones along the way

# ideas for flags:
- http server that serves data when the header is of a specific cookie or/and header value 

- the binary to audio wave lenght program

# my LAN idea with:
- a main event website i guess
- a point system
- some services and APIs for the challenges (sql, nodejs, php XD XD XD XD XD)

# flag distribution & point system:
- they must be short enough so participants can copy and paste, and long enough so
    they can't just guess it, 16 char long should be fine

- the participants should input the key to the website, then the website should
    confirm if it was successfully sent and the flag is valid
